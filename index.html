<h4 align="left"><b>Everything we incubate is open source</b></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">Hosted at the American Enterprise Institute, the Open Source Policy Center is built on the principle that better public policy analysis leads to better public policy. Since 2013, OSPC has incubated open source projects, including models and webapps, for predicting the outcomes of public policy. We identify tools that have the potential to fundamentally improve policymaking, and we help tool builders create open source projects that are professional, user oriented, and welcoming to outside technical contributors.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
Our <a style="display:inline-block" href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> of projects supports users including White Houses from both parties; national and local newspapers; dozens of university classes; Presidential campaigns in primary and general elections; academic, think tank, and independent researchers; companies and their consultants; and Congressional committees, specialized subcommittees, leadership offices, and member offices.
</div>
<br>
<p align="justify">Beyond incubation, we are committed to helping users by convening the open source community in Washington, D.C. and educating policymakers, modelers, and the public about open source policy analysis.</p> 

<p align="justify">Please sign up for our newsletter to learn about useful models, events, and resources for public policy decisionmaking.</p>
